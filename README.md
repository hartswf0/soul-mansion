# soul-mansion
We turn images into tiny programmable worlds. Each cell is a “mansion” that can house a role—Location, Entity, Goal, Obstacle, Shift, Solution.  No mysticism—just finite symbols under rules, judged by behavior. It’s Turing’s 1950 vision, but tactile: pictures become programs, and programs become performances.
